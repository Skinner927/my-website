Hello,

I'm a full stack web developer who specializes in AngularJS 1.x. I'm currently working at [Lastline](https://lastline.com) as a full-time web application developer. 

In my free time I like to tinker with hardware, experiment with app ideas, and work on old Volkswagens. 

Contact me on Google mail. My username is Skinner927. Sorry for phrasing that oddly, trying to avoid bot spam.
